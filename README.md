# Capstone Project - Shopping Coupon Recommendations
In this captsone project, a customer ecommerce shooping transaction data from Kaggle is used to evaluate data and compare the performance of recommendation models using Surprise library. 

## Business Objectives
The application is built based on the CRISP-DM framework. The following are the business objective of this application,
1. Identify the performance/accuracy score of recommendation Models
2. Identify the factors that affect the recommendation of coupons for the brand where a user have most event_type - viewed, in-cart or purchased.
3. Summarize and provide future recommendations

## Data
The dataset comes from the Kaggle data repository (https://www.kaggle.com/code/danofer/ecommerce-store-predict-purchases-data-prep/data?select=2019-Oct.csv). The data contains consumer user behavior data for a one month (October 2019) from a large multi-category online store. The dataset contains 26560620 entires with a total of 9 columns.
Each row in the file represents an user event. All events are related to products and users. There are different types of events.
- event_time: Time when event happened at (in UTC).
- event_type
-- view - a user viewed a product
-- cart - a user added a product to shopping cart
-- purchase - a user purchased a product
Typical funnel: view => cart => purchase
- product_id: ID of a product
- category_id: Product's category ID
- category_code: multi-hierarchical name of Product's category
- brand: Downcased string of brand name
- price: Float price of a product. Present
- user_id: Permanent user ID
- user_session: Temporary user's session ID. Same for each user's session. Is changed every time user come back to online store from a long pause.

EDA funtions like null checks, data massaging methods were performed to plot data charts to understand the data in detail. Price and Shopping Time features exhibited a higher correlation.

## Association Rules - Work In Progress (WIP)
1. PCA - to identify patterns in columns
2. K-Means  to identify patterns in rows

## Recommendation Models Used
The following Recommendation Models from SURPRISE library were used in this application,
1. BaselineOnly() - for baseline prediction
2. KNNBasic() - WIP
3. SVD()
4. NMF() - WIP
5. SlopeOne()
6. CoClustering()

In the initial analysis, **BaselineOnly()** and **SVD()** models performed better than the other models for the given dataset.

After the initial analysis, the *GridSearchCV()* is applied to identify the best hyperparamaters and improved the performance of these Recommendation Models. Among the improved models, **BaselineOnly()** and **SVD()** models outperformed the other improved Recommendation models.

### Feature Importance of top models - Work In Progress (WIP)
Based on all the model analysis, the following features exhibited the highest feature importance,
1. TBD
2. TBD

## Conclusion - Work In Progress (WIP)
To be concluded
